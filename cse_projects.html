			<p id="heading">Exploration of Motion Manifold of an Articulated Arm <i><font size=2>(Aug'15-Nov'15)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Extracted the motion manifold using visual data, generated by capturing images from vision sensors in a 3D simulation, for a 3-dof articulated arm, while extending a project on visual motion planning of multiple robots from 2D to 3D. Used ISOMAP for visualizing the image manifold, and resolved the reasons for its deviation from the ideal motion manifold.</p>

			<p id="heading">Course Helper <i><font size=2>(Mar-Apr'16)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Created a software solution for choosing appropriate courses at IIT Kanpur, which shows statistics about how many credits (of each type) does the student still have to complete and recommends courses to do in the following semester based on the student's department, program and previously completed courses. This project was done in a team of 2 under Prof. T.V. Prabhakar (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Texture Recognition and Synthesis using B-CNN <i><font size=2>(Mar-Apr'16)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Implemented the algorithm described by a paper by Subhransu Maji which used Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks to extract orderless representation of images which were used to recognize textures and manipulate other images. Image manipulation involved an optimization step, which used the L-BFGS algorithm according to the paper, but we wrote an ad-hoc gradient descent variant which ran faster on our system. This project was done in a group of 3 under Prof. Vinay Namboodiri (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Bayesian Non-Exhaustive Online Learning <i><font size=2>(Feb-Apr'16)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Studied and reviewed Bayesian learning and novelty detection algorithms which worked on non-exhaustive data-sets using Dirichlet Process Prior and Sequential Important Re-sampling. This project was done in a team of 3 under Prof. Piyush Rai (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Scalable Vocabulary Tree <i><font size=2>(Feb'16)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Implemented an instance recognition algorithm which used a vocabulary tree (hierarchical k-means clustering) over the SIFT features of the candidate images to create a TF-IDF scoring, in a group of 2 under Prof. Vinay Namboodiri (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Meaning Representation Parsing <i><font size=2>(Oct-Nov'15)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Generated the AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) for English sentences, after improving over the baseline provided by the organisers of Task 8, SemEval 2016, by better "focus" identification using an LSTM neural network, in a team of 2 under Prof. Amitabha Mukerjee (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Demand Predictor for Renting Bikes <i><font size=2>(Jan-Apr'15)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Experimented with regression and classification models in R for predicting the bike renting demand, according to the <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand">problem statement on Kaggle</a>, in a group of 4 under Prof. Harish Karnick (CSE, IIT Kanpur).<br>Implementation included:  &diams; Feature selection &diams; 3-component mixture model &diams; SVM &diams; Poisson Regression &diams; K-nearest neighbours &diams; Random Forest &diams; Gradient Boosted Regression and Classification Trees</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Perl to X86 Cross-Compiler on Python <i><font size=2>(Jan-Apr'15)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Generated an cross-compiler of Perl scripting language to x86 assembly language in Python, using Lex and Yacc tools of PLY python library, in a team of 3 (synchronized on <a href="https://github.com/Compilers-CS335/perl_compiler.git">GitHub</a> under Prof. Subhajit Roy (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Course Management System <i><font size=2>(Oct-Nov'14)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Developed a secure course management website for academic institutions for conducting live quizzes & assignments with automatic grade evaluation, in a team of 6 under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya (CSE, IIT Kanpur)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">Car Simulator Game C++ using OpenGL <i><font size=2>(Aug-Nov'14)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Created a car simulator in using OpenGL library in C++, under Prof. Vinay Namboodiri (CSE, IIT Kanpur). Implemented features include imported .3ds objects, Blinn-Phong lighting, textures, camera navigation & HUD</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p id="heading">DOM-Judge for Online Programming Contest <i><font size=2>(Jan-Mar'13)</font></i></p>
			<p id="body">Made an online programming contest website, under ACA (Association of Computing Activities), CSE, IIT Kanpur. Added certain features to the website like making a portal for queries with the judge, enhancing the presentation of the webpage, adding a clock and to synchronize it according to user position, etc.</p>
